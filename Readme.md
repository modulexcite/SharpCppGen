# SharpCppGen

SharpCppGen is a tool to generate pure C# code interop from C/C++ headers. 


## About

SharpCppGen was originally developed for the project [SharpDX](https://github.com/sharpdx/SharpDX) also known in this project as `SharpGen`. 

The original story about this project can be found back in 2010 in *[A new managed .NET/C# Direct3D 11 API generated from DirectX SDK headers](http://xoofx.com/blog/2010/10/19/managed-netc-direct3d-11-api-generated/)*  

This repository is an extract of SharpGen from SharpDX (Extract done using the project [git-rocket-filter](https://github.com/xoofx/GitRocketFilter)!)

The things that are still TODO to restore this project:
 
- [ ] Filter branch SharpGen from SharpDX
- [ ] Add proper Visual Studio solution
- [ ] Make SharpCppGen a standalone tool usable from the command line or a MSBuild Tasks
- [ ] Remove SharpDX specifics code path and make SharpCppGen suitable for other projects
- [ ] Integrate back SharpCppGen in SharpDX
- [ ] Add nuget package for easy integration
